# Virus-Trooper-Game

### Purpose of repo is just to get started with basic concepts of javascript.

It's a basic game where you are required to dodge some objects and win.
I used html, css and javascript to make it.

p.s: code looks a bit messy. You can just create a function for checking the overlapping condition and call it accordingly, instead of writing the whole condition again and again.
